My first Scratch project.

You are docking your ship to the space station. The controls mimic those of an aircraft.
Your control inputs will move the red cross-hairs relative to the station.

You can see the distance to the station in the upper left corner. The units can be whatever
you'd like them to be (meters, hands, smoots, whatever you can wrap your brain around).

Note: The initial position of the ship is (mostly) random and not all starting positions are 
dockable.

Regrets: This is hardly as ambitious as I had planned initially. Since I'm not a disciplined and 
well-studied coder, I had to keep it fairly simple. Still much to learn!

Cheers!
